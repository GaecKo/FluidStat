## Adding FluidStat as a command
If you wish to have FluidStat available as a global command in your Linux terminal, you can follow these steps:
1) You need to access the `bin/` folder located at the root of your system (`~/bin`) 
2) Once your are there, create a new file:
    ```bash
    sudo touch FluidStat
    ```
    > You need sudo as you are in the system files
3) You then have to add this content to it:
    ```bash
    python3 /../../home/USER/PATH_TO_PROJECT/FluidStat/plot.py $1
    ```
    > Where `USER` is your Linux username and `PATH_TO_PROJECT` the path to where you installed the project

    > You may need to use `sudo vim FluidStat` or `sudo nano FluidStat`

4) Give the autorisation to execute the file:
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x FluidStat
    ```

5) You should now be able to launch the command from anywhere:
    ```bash
    FluidStat -cpu
    FluidStat -ram
    FluidStat -btry
    ```

## Extra Note
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This project is WIP, the initial idea was to built a full desktop app using `fbs`, `PySide6`, ...
> As current state can tell, this is only a funny little project on which I don't plan on working anymore. The code is therefore really simple and basic.
